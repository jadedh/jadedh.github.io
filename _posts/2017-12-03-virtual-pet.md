The goal of the project is to implement a virtual pet, tamagotchi, which must be taken care of by the users so it maintain all the basic animal needs for instance hunger, happiness etc.

To implement our design on the **MSP432P401R** and **EDU-MMKII Booster pack** the LCD screen on the Booster pack plays an essential role in the project as all of the functions are performed on the screen.
