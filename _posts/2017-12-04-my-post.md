**Networking the Physical** World is one of my favorite class at BU. During this class I was able to work with fellow hardworking teammates to develop functional IoT devices and explore the new wireless technologies.

Some of the cool technologies used includes:
* Photon Particle
* 2.4GHz XBee module
* Arduino Uno
* Raspberry Pi 3B
* TCRT1000 optical sensor
* LIDAR sensor
