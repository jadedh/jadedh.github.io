Hello, my name is Jade Dhangwattanotai. I'm a computer engineer student at Boston University. I'm originally from Bangkok, Thailand. The reason why I chose to pursue engineering degree and career in technology at BU is because of Boston's reputation as the innovation hub of the New England region. During my free time I enjoy learning about culture and languages, exercising, traveling and keeping up with the tech world. I also love to get involve with BU students organizations and meeting goal-driven fellows at BU.

BU Student with experience as Research Assistant with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry. Skilled in C, C++, C#, Python, Java and JavaScript. Research professional with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree focused in Computer Engineering from Boston University.
